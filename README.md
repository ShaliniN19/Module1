## Ex 01: Conditional Statements in Python: Even or Odd Checker

## Aim

To write a Python program to check whether the given number is even or odd using if...else statements.

## Algorithm

1.Get an input from the user.

2.Convert the input to an integer and store it in a variable a.

3.Use the modulo operator % to check if a % 2 == 0.

    1.If true, print "EVEN".
    
    2.Else, print "ODD".
    
4.End the program.


## Program

```
num = int(input())
if num%2==0:
    print("EVEN")
else:
    print("ODD")

```
## Output

## Result
Thus the Python Program for determining whether the given number is odd or even has been executed successfully and the output has been verified.

## Ex 2:Datatypes-Boolean Expression Evaluation in Python
## Aim
To write a Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving True and False.

## Algorithm
1.Set variable a to the result of the expression 0 == True.

2.Set variable b to the result of the expression False == False.

3.Set variable c to the result of the expression True + True.

4.Set variable d to the result of the expression False + 9.

5.Print the value of a with the label "a is".

6.Print the value of b with the label "b is".

7.Print the value of c with the label "c:".

8.Print the value of d with the label "d:".

## Program
```
a = (0 == True)
b = (False == False)
c = True + True
d = False + 9

print("a is", a)
print("b is", b)
print("c:", c)
print("d:", d)
```

## Output
<img width="514" height="399" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-04 105949" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b6c40ef-4609-40c1-919b-29477e1d1ffe" />



## Result
Thus the given Python program has been executed successfully and the output has been verified.

## EX 03: Datatypes-Character Literal in Python

## Aim
To write a Python program that prints the characters 'T' and 'a' using character literals.

## Algorithm

1.Print the character 'T'.

2.Print the character 'a'.
## Program
```
print('T')
print('a')
```

## Output
<img width="606" height="358" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-04 110655" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5f26176-38eb-4ad5-a0d8-adce03429c83" />


## Result
Thus the given Python Program has been exceuted successfully and the output has been verified.

## EX 04- Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python
## Aim
To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts.

## Algorithm
1.Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable a (real part).

2.Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable b (imaginary part).

3.Create a complex number x using the complex(a, b) function.

4.Print the complex number x.

5.Print the real part of x using x.real.

6.Print the imaginary part of x using x.imag.

## Program
```
a = int(input())
b = int(input())

x = complex(a, b)

print(x)
print(x.real)
print(x.imag)

```
## Output
<img width="307" height="231" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-04 111405" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50af8c78-921a-4dbc-8a11-cc5d6969e2d9" />


## Result
Therefore the given Python Program has been executed succeefully and the output has been verified.

## EX 05-Datatypes-Read and Print a String in Python
## Aim
To write a Python program to read a string from the user and then print it.

## Algorithm
1.Assign a variable named men_stepped_on_the_moon.

2.Use input() to read a string from the user and store it in the variable.

3.Print the value stored in the variable.

## Program

```
men_stepped_on_the_moon = input()
print(men_stepped_on_the_moon)

```

## Output

<img width="395" height="226" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-04 111526" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ffdc6ef-5703-46d3-8e24-3acfc6fb9808" />

## Result
Therfore the given Python program has been executed successfully and the output has been verified.
